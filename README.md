# Chingu-Voyage
## Build-to-Learn Team Project - Repo Starter

You're hear because you joined the Chingu Voyage cohort. Are you ready to build something awesome?

This is where the collaboration magic will happen. For instructions and inspiration on what you'll be building read-up on the [projects line-up](https://medium.com/chingu/chingu-voyage-clone-projects-lineup-feec0a4cdef0).

## Using GitHub

For an interactive intro to collaborating on GitHub try out the [GitHub's own on-demand courses](https://services.github.com/on-demand/). When completing the GitHub 101, you'll be using "GitHub Flow" with the "shared repository" collaboration model. For your B2L work, this is recommended! 

For more on the "shared repository" and it's complement, [check this out](https://github.com/chingu-coders/GitHub-tips#collaborating-on-github---a-tale-of-two-models).

To facilitate project management, you can optionally take advantage of the [project board feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/). It's an alternate to having to use yet-another-collab-tool such as Google Docs or Trello just for that purpose (but they're fine too!).

## About the Files in this Repo Starter

* **.editorconfig**: EditorConfig helps enforce consistent coding style between different editors and IDEs. There's no need to worry about whether you should be using spaces or tabs! Some editors/IDEs have automatic support but other's require a plugin. Check the [webpage to find out](http://editorconfig.org/).
* **.gitignore**: Tells git to ignore files you *don't* want to check-in. The included one is a default for Node projects. This way you won't accidentally check-in your entire ``node_modules`` repository!
* **README.md**: This file. The front-page for your app. Once you're onto something good be sure to wipe this content away. You could track progress here or just tell people about your app and how to build or contribute. Here's an example from a [previous Chingu B2L project](https://github.com/chingu-coders/paypal-otters).
